            Hello! My full name is Edgar Joshua James Miranda, but you can call me Joshua.
            I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I was born in Potosí, where I lived for about
            10 years, and later I moved to Cochabamba, where I currently live.
            I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy learning
            about programming, web development, and how technology can help people solve
            real-life problems.
            In my free time, I like spending time with friends and family, listening to
            music, learning new skills, and improving my English. I am motivated to grow
            both personally and professionally through my studies.
