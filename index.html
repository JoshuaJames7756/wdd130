            <p>
                Hello! My full name is Edgar Joshua James Miranda, but you can call me Joshua.
                I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I was born in Potosí, where I lived for about
                10 years, and later I moved to Cochabamba, where I currently live.
                I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy learning
                about programming, web development, and how technology can help people solve
                real-life problems.
                In my free time, I like spending time with friends and family, listening to
                music, learning new skills, and improving my English. I am motivated to grow
                both personally and professionally through my studies.
            </p>

            <img src="images/bolivia.jpg" alt="Hello, This is Copacabana-Bolivia" width="200">
            <p> Copacabana is the main Bolivian town on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The town has a
                large 17th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana, dedicated to Our
                Lady
                of Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia. The town is a tourism destination in
                Bolivia. It is also known for its trout and quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount
                Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the town has approximately 6,000 inhabitants.
                Copacabana's religious celebrations, cultural heritage and
                traditional festivals are well known throughout Bolivia. Boats leave for Isla del
                Sol,
                the sacred
                Inca island, from Copacabana. Copacabana is served by Copacabana Airport.</p>
