        <p>
            Hello! My full name is Edgar Joshua James Miranda, but you can call me Joshua.
            I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I was born in Potosí, where I lived for about
            10 years, and later I moved to Cochabamba, where I currently live.
            I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy learning
            about programming, web development, and how technology can help people solve
            real-life problems.
            In my free time, I like spending time with friends and family, listening to
            music, learning new skills, and improving my English. I am motivated to grow
            both personally and professionally through my studies.

        <img src="images/bolivia.jpg" alt="Hello, This is Copacabana-Bolivia" width="200">
        <p> Copacabana is the main Bolivian town on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The town has a large
            17th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana, dedicated to Our Lady of
            Copacabana,
            the patron saint of Bolivia. The town is a tourism destination in Bolivia. It is also
            known
            for its
            trout and quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the
            town
            has
            approximately 6,000 inhabitants. Copacabana's religious celebrations, cultural heritage
            and
            traditional festivals are well known throughout Bolivia. Boats leave for Isla del Sol,
            the
            sacred
            Inca island, from Copacabana. Copacabana is served by Copacabana Airport.</p>
